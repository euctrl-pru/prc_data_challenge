    "text": "The Data\nThe Performance Review Commission (PRC) Data Challenge aims at engaging with data scientists, even without Aviation background, to create teams and compete to build an open Machine Learning (ML) model able to accurately infer the Actual TakeOff Weight (ATOW) of a flown flight.\nWe provide information for 369013 flights flown all over Europe in 2022. Flight data include origin/destination airport, aircraft type, off-block and arrival times,…and estimated TakeOff Weight (TOW). Thanks to the collaboration with OpenSky Network (OSN) we added the relevant trajectories at (max) 1 second granularity, accounting for around 158 GiB of parquet files.\nThe 105959 flights of the submission_set.csv will be used to rank the intermediate submissions before the deadline, and an additional 52190 will be used for the final prize ranking.\nSee the Data page for more details.",

    "section": "The why of Why",
    "text": "The why of Why\nWe got many questions about this challenge. We grouped and answered them as follows:\n\nWhy is the challenge focusing on ATOW?\nATOW is an important input for models estimating fuel burnt and derived gaseous emissions.\nThe current lack of openly available ATOW is typically compensated by assuming it to be equal to a certain percentage of the Maximum TakeOff Weight (MTOW) for the relevant aircraft model.\nWith this challenge we aim at making available a better way to estimate ATOW, i.e. an Estimated TakeOff Weight (ETOW).\nWhy an Open model?\nThe PRC (and many other Organizations, industrial actors and academia by the way) is interested in studies assessing the impact of Aviation to Climate Change. To this extent the availability of an open model allows for reproducibility, transparency of the results presented and in the end to trust in the performed analyses.\nWhy via a Data Challenge?\nThe PRC thinks that there is a great pool of Data Scientists (much bigger than that of Aviation Experts!) that could help defining the open model of the Challenge.\nThe Challenge also makes it possible to have a white box approach to the way the model is being defined which goes in the direction of transparency. This transparency is a way to build trust, reproducibility and eventually evolve a collaboration to improve the understanding (and the reduction) of the impact of Aviation to the environment.",

(note: few thousand flights have no trajectory available)\nThe daily trajectory files contain:\n\nflight identification: unique ID (flight_id, same as for flight list), (obfuscated) ICAO 24-bit address (icao24, same value as flight_id)\n4D position: longitude [DD, decimal degrees in -180/180 range] and latitude [DD, decimal degrees in -90/90 range], altitude [ft], timestamp [timestamp with time zone]\nspeed: ground speed (groundspeed [kt]), track angle (track and track_unwrapped [decimal degrees]), vertical rate of climb/descent (vertical_rate [ft/min])\n(optionally) meteorological info at 4D position:\n\nwind (u_component_of_wind and v_component_of_wind [m/s])\ntemperature [\\(K\\), kelvin]\n\n\nThe daily file &lt;yyyy-mm-dd&gt;.parquet includes all position reports on (UTC) &lt;yyyy-mm-dd&gt; date; it can happen that flight portions be present in consecutive files, i.e. the same flight_id will occur in more than one daily file because the flight took place across the (UTC) midnight.\nNOTE: trajectories are not necessarily complete/overlapping with respect to what reported in the flight list in actual_offblock_time or arrival_time. This is due to the possibly limited/partial ADS-B coverage in some parts (or some lower altitudes) of the world. The interval [actual_offblock_time + taxiout_time, arrival_time] is a good approximation of the in-the-air portion of the flight.\nFurther info material:\n\nTrack in aviation: SkyBrary page\nGround speed: SkyBrary page\n\n\n\nRationale for the data sets\nOur gut feelings say that Actual TakeOff Weight (ATOW) depends in some forms from:\n\norigin/destination: the great circle distance is of course a factor in terms of how much fuel you will have to tank and hence the take-off weight.\nADEP or ADES are important because of specific local procedures.\nADEP/ADES could also be important because different AOs plan and execute flights differently from/to the same airport.\ntiming: when you execute a flight, i.e. morning/evening/night, weekly patterns, seasonal trends (IATA season schedule2), local time (?), flight duration calculation, could be a factor to consider\naircraft: the (ICAO) type3 will imply different amounts of fuel needed,\nairline: policies varies, for example for same city-pair one airline could select different alternates from another airline depending on their technical support facilities/contracts.\nAlso AOs have different tanking policies.\noperational: flown route length (different from great circle distance) could better refine ATOW estimation; same for taxi-out duration\ntrajectory: The ADS-B trajectory can help to classify the way a flight has been flown (rate of climb/descent, maximum en-route flight level, …) and hence refine the ATOW estimate.",

Some of us also have a social science background at Sciences Po\n\n\nRationale for participation\nWe are all interested in participating in interesting and well-thought ML projects, even more when they are for open source. We think the subject is interesting and clearly defined, making it a great opportunity for learning and hands-on experience. I personally discovered this challenge when digging on SDR-related projects, as I have been amazed by airplanes since my childhood (I was actually looking to build my own Radio to add it to the Open Sky Network). I have invited a few friends to join me on this challenge and work as a team, and we are looking forward to modelization, and to playing with the data",

He works on various aspects of contrail cirrus and airborne measurements, and lectures on aviation climate impact, now at the Technical University Munich. Prof. Ian Poll published a series of open-access aircraft performance models. Dr. Roger Teoh is Scientist at Imperial College (with Prof. Dr Marc Stettler) and published, since 2019, several papers on contrail modelling\n\n\nRationale for participation\nWe plan to derive best estimates of the aircraft takeoff mass (at least upper and lower bounds) by comparing the given flight trajectories with the restrictions resulting from performance modelling using the open access PS Performance model. The most recent model PS model version covers 67 ICAO aircraft types, hopefully including all aircraft types in the set of test data, and provides several criteria to deduce the achievability of the given flight states in respect to Flight level, Mach number, climb rate, vertical and horizontal accelerations, thrust, and lift coefficient, for the potential range of aircraft mass consistent with the takeoff mass, past fuel consumption, including all flight states from departure to destination. This should allow to estimate at least upper and lower bounds of the aircraft mass. The PS model is available among other within the pycontrail code ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7776686 ). The PS model got improved over the years, and further improvements are to be expected. The team coordinator works mainly with Fortran, partially with Excel and partially with python",
