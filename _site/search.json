    "text": "The why of Why\nWe got many questions about this challenge. We grouped and answered them as follows:\n\nWhy is the challenge focusing on ATOW?\nATOW is an important input for models estimating fuel burnt and derived gaseous emissions.\nThe current lack of openly available ATOW is typically compensated by assuming it to be equal to a certain percentage of the Maximum TakeOff Weight (MTOW) for the relevant aircraft model.\nWith this challenge we aim at making available a better way to estimate ATOW, i.e. an Estimated TakeOff Weight (ETOW).\nWhy an Open model?\nThe PRC (and many other Organizations, industrial actors and academia by the way) is interested in studies assessing the impact of Aviation to Climate Change. To this extent the availability of an open model allows for reproducibility, transparency of the results presented and in the end to trust in the performed analyses.\nWhy via a Data Challenge?\nThe PRC thinks that there is a great pool of Data Scientists that could help to define the open model of the Challenge, but above that, it is the importance to have a white box approach to the way the model is being built.\nThis transparency is a way to build trust, reproducibility and eventually evolve a collaboration to improve the understanding (and the reduction) of the impact of Aviation to the environment.",

This is due to the possibly limited/partial ADS-B coverage in some parts (or some lower altitudes) of the world. The interval [actual_offblock_time + taxiout_time, arrival_time] is a good approximation of the in-the-air portion of the flight.\nFurther info material:\n\nTrack in aviation: SkyBrary page\nGround speed: SkyBrary page\n\n\n\nRationale for the data sets\nOur gut feelings say that Actual TakeOff Weight (ATOW) depends in some forms from:\n\norigin/destination: the great circle distance is of course a factor in terms of how much fuel you will have to tank and hence the take-off weight.\nADEP or ADES are important because of specific local procedures.\nADEP/ADES could also be important because different AOs plan and execute flights differently from/to the same airport.\ntiming: when you execute a flight, i.e. morning/evening/night, weekly patterns, seasonal trends (IATA season schedule2), local time (?), flight duration calculation, could be a factor to consider\naircraft: the (ICAO) type3 will imply different amounts of fuel needed,\nairline: policies varies, for example for same city-pair one airline could select different alternates from another airline depending on their technical support facilities/contracts.\nAlso AOs have different tanking policies.\noperational: flown route length (different from great circle distance) could better refine ATOW estimation; same for taxi-out duration\ntrajectory: The ADS-B trajectory can help to classify the way a flight has been flown (rate of climb/descent, maximum en-route flight level, …) and hence refine the ATOW estimate.",
