    "section": "The why of Why",
    "text": "The why of Why\nWe got many questions about this challenge. We grouped and answered them as follows:\n\nWhy is the challenge focusing on ATOW?\nATOW is an important input to fuel burnt and gaseous emissions models. The current lack of ATOW is typically compensated by assuming it to be equal to a certain percentage of the Maximum TakeOff Weight (MTOW) for the relevant aircraft model.\nWith this challenge we aim at making available a better way to estimate ATOW.\nWhy an Open model?\nThe PRC (and many other Organizations, industrial actors and academia by the way) is interested in studies assessing the impact of Aviation to Climate Change. To this extent the availability of an open model allows for reproducibility, transparency of the results presented and in the end to trust.\nWhy via a Challenge?\nThe PRC thinks that there is a great pool of Data Scientists that could help to define the open model of the Challenge, but above that it is the importance to have a “white box” approach to the way the model is being built that drove the decision to setup a Data Challenge. This transparency is a way to build trust, reproducibility and eventually evolve a collaboration to improve the understanding of the impact of Aviation to the environment."
