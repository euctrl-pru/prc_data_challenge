## Data for modeling

We propose two data sets:

1. a flight list of (a subset of) flights flown in Europe in 2023
1. the relevant trajectories for the above flights

The data sets for the challenge are organized as follows:

```text
data/flights
├── 2023-01-01
│   ├── 258079060.parquet
│   ├── 258081025.parquet
│   ├── 258091625.parquet
│   ├── ...
│   └── flights.csv
└── 2023-01-02
│   ├── ...
│   └── flights.csv
└── ...
```

and for each date they consist of

* flight list of (a subset of) flown flights of the day, i.e. `flights.csv`
* associated (\acr{ADS-B} based) flown trajectories augmented with wind information[^1],
  i.e. `258081025.parquet`

ERA5 is the fifth generation of the [\acr{ECMWF}][ecmwf]
Atmospheric Reanalysis, providing hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land, and oceanic climate variables.  
The Google Cloud Public Dataset Program hosts ERA5 data that spans from 1940 to recent days,
covering the Earth on a 30 km grid and resolves the atmosphere using 137 levels from
the surface up to a height of 80 km.

### Flight List
The flight list provides details such as

* flight identification: unique ID, ~~(obfuscated) callsign~~
* origin/destination: \acr{ADEP}, \acr{ADES} and ancillary info (NAME and ISO2C COUNTRY code)
* timing: \acr{AOBT}, \acr{ARVT}; both from \acr{NM}
* aircraft: aircraft type (ICAO), \acr{WTC}
* airline: \acr{AO} code (ICAO), 
* operational values: flight duration, taxi time, route length, (estimated) \acr{TOW}

### Trajectory
The trajectory contains

* flight identification: unique ID
* 4D position: longitude, latitude, altitude, timestamp, 
* speed: ground speed, track
* wind speed



### Rationale for the data sets

Our gut feelings say that \acr{ATOW} depends in some forms from:

* origin/destination: the great circle distance is of course a factor in terms of how much fuel
  you will have to tank and hence the take-off weight.  
  Also \acr{ADEP} or \acr{ADES} are important because of specific local procedures.  
  \acr{ADEP}/\acr{ADES} could also be important because different
  \acr{AO}s plan and execute flights differently for/to the same airport.
* timing: when you execute a flight, i.e. morning/evening, weekly patterns, seasonal trends, local time (?),
  flight duration calculation, could be a factor to consider
* aircraft: of course the (ICAO) type will imply different amounts of fuel needed, but also specific
  aircraft (hence REGISTRATION) could be singled out
* airline: policies varies, for example for same city-pair an airline could select different
  alternates according to their technical support facilities/contracts.  
  Also \acr{AO}s have different tanking policies.
* operational: flown route length (different from great circle distance) could better refine
  \acr{ATOW} estimation; same for taxing duration
* trajectory: The \acr{ADS-B} trajectory can help to classify the way a flight has been flown and
  hence refine the \acr{ATOW} estimate


## Data for submission

The data sets for the submission are organized as follows:

```text
data/submission
├── 258079011.parquet
├── 258081111.parquet
├── 258097425.parquet
├── ...
└── submission.csv

```

and consist of 

* (CSV) list of flight IDs and to-be-estimated TOW, `submission.csv`, i.e.
  ```
  id, TOW
  258081039,
  258081111,
  ...
  ```

## Ranking
For ranking you'll need to upload your

1. `submission_<team>.csv` with the estimated TOWs
2. the URL of the tagged (public) repository of the model used to estimate TOW
