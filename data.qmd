## Data for modeling

We propose two data sets:

1. a flight list of (a subset of) flights flown in Europe in 2022
1. the relevant trajectories for the above flights

The data sets for the challenge are organized as follows:

```text
competition-data/
├── challenge_set.csv
├── 2022-01-01.parquet
├── 2022-01-02.parquet
└── ...
```

Each daily trajectory file contains (\acr{ADS-B} based) flown trajectories
augmented with meteo information[^1].

[^1]: from [Google's Analysis-Ready, Cloud Optimized (ARCO) ERA5][google-era5]:  
ERA5 is the fifth generation of the [\acr{ECMWF}][ecmwf]
Atmospheric Reanalysis, providing hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land, and oceanic climate variables.  
The Google Cloud Public Dataset Program hosts ERA5 data that spans from 1940 to recent days,
covering the Earth on a 30 km grid and resolves the atmosphere using 137 levels from
the surface up to a height of 80 km.

### Flight List
The flight list provides details such as (`column names` in parenthesis):

* flight identification: unique ID (`fuid`), (obfuscated) callsign (`callsign`)
* origin/destination: \acr{ADEP} (`adep`), \acr{ADES} (`ades`) and ancillary info
  (NAME [`name_adep`, `name_ades`] and ISO2C COUNTRY code [`country_code_adep`, `country_code_ades`])
* timing: date of flight (`date`), \acr{AOBT} (`actual_offblock_time`), \acr{ARVT} (`arrival_time`);
  \acr{AOBT} and \acr{ARVT} from \acr{NM}
* aircraft: (ICAO) aircraft type code (`aircraft_type`), \acr{WTC} (`wtc`)
* airline: (obfuscated) \acr{AO} code (`airline`), 
* operational values: flight duration (`flight_duration`) [min], taxi-out time (`taxiout_time`) [min],
  route length (`flown_distance`) [nm], (estimated) \acr{TOW} (`tow`) [kg]

### Trajectory
The trajectory contains

* flight identification: unique ID (`fuid`, same as for flight list)
* 4D position: `longitude` and `latitude` (decimal degrees), `altitude`, `timestamp`
* speed: ground speed (`groundspeed`), track angle (`track` and `track_unwrapped`),
  vertical rate of climb/descent (`vertical_rate`)
* (optionally) meteo info at 4D position:
  - wind (`u_component_of_wind` and `v_component_of_wind`) [$m s^{-1}$]
  - `temperature` [$K$, kelvin]

### Rationale for the data sets

Our gut feelings say that \acr{ATOW} depends in some forms from:

* origin/destination: the great circle distance is of course a factor in terms of how much fuel
  you will have to tank and hence the take-off weight.  
  Also \acr{ADEP} or \acr{ADES} are important because of specific local procedures.  
  \acr{ADEP}/\acr{ADES} could also be important because different
  \acr{AO}s plan and execute flights differently for/to the same airport.
* timing: when you execute a flight, i.e. morning/evening/night, weekly patterns,
  seasonal trends, local time (?),
  flight duration calculation, could be a factor to consider
* aircraft: of course the (ICAO) type will imply different amounts of fuel needed,
* airline: policies varies, for example for same city-pair an airline could select different
  alternates according to their technical support facilities/contracts.  
  Also \acr{AO}s have different tanking policies.
* operational: flown route length (different from great circle distance) could better refine
  \acr{ATOW} estimation; same for taxi-out duration
* trajectory: The \acr{ADS-B} trajectory can help to classify the way a flight has been flown and
  hence refine the \acr{ATOW} estimate


## Data for submission

The data sets for the submission are organized as follows:

```text
data/submission
├── 258079011.parquet
├── 258081111.parquet
├── 258097425.parquet
├── ...
└── submission.csv

```

and consist of 

* (CSV) list of flight IDs and to-be-estimated TOW, `submission.csv`, i.e.
  ```
  id, TOW
  258081039,
  258081111,
  ...
  ```

## Ranking
For ranking you'll need to upload your

1. `submission_<team>.csv` with the estimated TOWs
2. the URL of the tagged (public) repository of the model used to estimate TOW
