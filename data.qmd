## Data for modeling

We propose two data sets:

1. a flight list of (a subset of) flights flown in Europe in 2022
1. the relevant trajectories for the above flights

The data sets for the challenge are organized as follows:

```text
competition-data/
├── challenge_set.csv
├── 2022-01-01.parquet
├── 2022-01-02.parquet
└── ...
```

Each daily trajectory file contains (\acr{ADS-B} based) flown trajectories
augmented with meteo information[^1].

[^1]: from [Google's Analysis-Ready, Cloud Optimized (ARCO) ERA5][google-era5]:  
ERA5 is the fifth generation of the [\acr{ECMWF}][ecmwf]
Atmospheric Reanalysis, providing hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land, and oceanic climate variables.  
The Google Cloud Public Dataset Program hosts ERA5 data that spans from 1940 to recent days,
covering the Earth on a 30 km grid and resolves the atmosphere using 137 levels from
the surface up to a height of 80 km.

### Flight List
The flight list provides details such as (`column names` in parenthesis, [_units_]
in italic in square brackets when appropriate):

* flight identification: unique ID (`flight_id`), (obfuscated) callsign (`callsign`)
* origin/destination: \acr{ADEP} (`adep` [_ICAO code_]), \acr{ADES} (`ades` [_ICAO code_])
  and ancillary info, i.e. airport name (`name_adep`, `name_ades`) and country code 
  (`country_code_adep`, `country_code_ades` [_ISO2C_])
* timing: date of flight (`date` [_ISO 8601 UTC date_]),
  \acr{AOBT} (`actual_offblock_time` [_ISO 8601 UTC date and time_]),
  \acr{ARVT} (`arrival_time` [_ISO 8601 UTC date and time_);
  \acr{AOBT} and \acr{ARVT} from \acr{NM}
* aircraft: aircraft type code (`aircraft_type` [_ICAO aircraft type_]),
  \acr{WTC} (`wtc`); see [ICAO aircraft type designator page][act_type]
* airline: (obfuscated) \acr{AO} code (`airline`), 
* operational values: flight duration (`flight_duration` [_min_]) , 
  taxi-out time (`taxiout_time` [_min_]),
  route length (`flown_distance` [_nmi_]) , (estimated) \acr{TOW} (`tow` [_kg_])

### Trajectory
The trajectory contains

* flight identification: unique ID (`flight_id`, same as for flight list)
* 4D position: `longitude` [_DD_, decimal degrees in -90/90 range] and
  `latitude` [_DD_, decimal degrees in -180/180 range],
  `altitude` [_ft_], `timestamp` [_timestamp with time zone_]
* speed: ground speed (`groundspeed` [_kt_]), 
  track angle (`track` and `track_unwrapped` [_decimal degrees_]),
  vertical rate of climb/descent (`vertical_rate` [_ft/min_])
* (optionally) meteo info at 4D position:
  - wind (`u_component_of_wind` and `v_component_of_wind`) [_m/s_]
  - `temperature` [$K$, kelvin]

### Rationale for the data sets

Our gut feelings say that \acr{ATOW} depends in some forms from:

* origin/destination: the great circle distance is of course a factor in terms of how much fuel
  you will have to tank and hence the take-off weight.  
  Also \acr{ADEP} or \acr{ADES} are important because of specific local procedures.  
  \acr{ADEP}/\acr{ADES} could also be important because different
  \acr{AO}s plan and execute flights differently for/to the same airport.
* timing: when you execute a flight, i.e. morning/evening/night, weekly patterns,
  seasonal trends, local time (?),
  flight duration calculation, could be a factor to consider
* aircraft: of course the (ICAO) type will imply different amounts of fuel needed,
* airline: policies varies, for example for same city-pair an airline could select different
  alternates according to their technical support facilities/contracts.  
  Also \acr{AO}s have different tanking policies.
* operational: flown route length (different from great circle distance) could better refine
  \acr{ATOW} estimation; same for taxi-out duration
* trajectory: The \acr{ADS-B} trajectory can help to classify the way a flight has been flown and
  hence refine the \acr{ATOW} estimate


## Data for submission

The data sets for the submission are organized as follows:

```text
data/submission
├── 258079011.parquet
├── 258081111.parquet
├── 258097425.parquet
├── ...
└── submission.csv

```

and consist of 

* (CSV) list of flight IDs and to-be-estimated TOW, `submission.csv`, i.e.
  ```
  flight_id, tow
  258081039,
  258081111,
  ...
  ```

## Ranking
For ranking you'll need to upload your

> `<team>_submission_<posix timestamp>.csv` with the estimated TOWs

## Eligibility for Prize

The winning solutions will only be eligible for the awards if all source code
and additional data sets used to generate the results from the measurement data
will be made available to be published under the GNU GPLv3 license on the
OpenSky Network's github account.

In addition, sufficient documentation must be provided to understand and
reproduce the results.
