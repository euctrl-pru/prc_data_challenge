We propose two data sets:

1. a flight list for flights flown in Europe in 2023
1. the relevant trajectories for the above flights

### Flight List
The flight list provides details such as

* flight identification: unique ID, callsign
* origin/destination: \acr{ADEP}, \acr{ADES} and ancillary info (NAME and ISO2C COUNTRY code)
* timing: \acr{AOBT} from \acr{NM}, \acr{ARVT} from \acr{NM}
* aircraft: aircraft type (ICAO), wake turbulence category, registration
* airline: \acr{AO} code (ICAO), (and callsign, which embeds \acr{AO} identification)
* operational values: flight duration, taxi time, route length, (estimated) takeoff weight

### Trajectory
The trajectory contains

* flight identification: unique ID, callsign
* 4D position: longitude, latitude, altitude, timestamp, 
* speed: ground speed
* wind speed

### Rationale for the data sets

Our gut feelings say that \acr{ATOW} depends in some forms from:

* origin/destination: the great circle distance is of course a factor in terms of how much fuel
  you will have to tank and hence the take-off weight.  
  Also \acr{ADEP} or \acr{ADES} are important because of specific local procedures.  
  \acr{ADEP}/\acr{ADES} could also be important because different
  \acr{AO}s plan and execute flights differently for/to the same airport.
* timing: when you execute a flight, i.e. morning/evening, weekly patterns, seasonal trends, local time (?),
  flight duration calculation, could be a factor to consider
* aircraft: of course the (ICAO) type will imply different amounts of fuel needed, but also specific
  aircraft (hence REGISTRATION) could be singled out
* airline: policies varies, for example for same city-pair an airline could select different
  alternates according to their technical support facilities/contracts.  
  Also \acr{AO}s have different tanking policies.
* operational: flown route length (different from great circle distance) could better refine
  \acr{ATOW} estimation; same for taxing duration
* trajectory: The \acr{ADS-B} trajectory can help to classify the way a flight has been flown and
  hence refine the \acr{ATOW} estimate
