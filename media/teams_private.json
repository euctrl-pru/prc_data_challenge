The most recent model PS model version covers 67 ICAO aircraft types, hopefully including all aircraft types in the set of test data, and provides several criteria to deduce the achievability of the given flight states in respect to Flight level,  Mach number, climb rate, vertical and horizontal accelerations, thrust, and lift coefficient, for the potential range of aircraft mass consistent with the takeoff mass, past fuel consumption, including all flight states from departure to destination. This should allow to estimate at least upper and lower bounds of the aircraft mass. The PS model is available among other within the pycontrail code ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7776686 ). The PS model got improved over the  years, and further improvements are to be expected. The  team coordinator works mainly with Fortran, partially with Excel and partially with python",
