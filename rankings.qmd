## Criteria for Ranking Intermediate Submissions

::: {.callout-warning title="Attention"}
#### 2024-10-17T18:16Z Final phase has started!
Submission shall be send for the 158149 `flight_id`'s as in

> `competition-data/final_submission_set.csv`

:::

Intermediate submissions are ranked on RMSE of the submitted `tow` with respect
to the (hidden) "ground truth for the `flight_id`'s in `submission_set.csv` ".

There are 105959 `flight_id`'s in `submission_set.csv`.


## Criteria for Ranking of Final Submission

::: {.callout-warning title="Attention"}
#### 2024-10-17T18:16Z Final phase has started!
Submission shall be send for the 158149 `flight_id`'s as in

> `competition-data/final_submission_set.csv`

:::


Final ranking will be based on 

* RMSE from `competition-data/final_submission_set.csv` (it will be posted around
  1 week before the deadline) which includes an additional 52190 flights
  compared to `competition-data/submission_set.csv`


### Eligibility for Prize

The winning solutions will only be eligible for the awards if

* all source code and additional data sets used to generate the results from
  the measurement data will be made available to be published under the
  **GNU GPLv3 license** on the OpenSky Network's github account.
* sufficient documentation is provided to understand and reproduce the results.
* the solution is _original_: teams must use their own original solutions.
  Re-using any existing implementation is only allowed if the original authors 
  grant you the rights to use their solution and if you made significant modifications 
  to the algorithm or model.
  In particular, simply re-using existing code and rewriting the data input and 
  output mechanism is not sufficient. Adding parameters to the model and modifying
  filters to match the specific peculiarities of the data, however, can be 
  considered sufficient. 


### Final Prize 

The Selection Committee will review and discuss the top ranking teams and
select final Awardees considering

1. their final ranking score,
1. the originality of the proposed model
1. the open availability of the code and the relevant documentation provided.

By participating in the Challenge, you agree to be bound by the final decision
of the PRC Data Challenge selection committee.
