title: "PRC Data Challenge"
---

The \acr{PRC} Data Challenge aims at engaging data scientists to
build a model able to accurately infer the \acr{ATOW} of a flown flight.

We look for data scientist teams, even without Aviation background, to participate
to the challenge in order to compete to develop an **open** model using suitable \acr{ML}
techniques.

## The Data
See the [Data page](data.html) for more details.


## The why of Why

We got many questions about this challenge. We grouped and answered them as follows:

* Why is the challenge focusing on \acr{ATOW}?  
  \acr{ATOW} is an important input to fuel burnt and gaseous emissions models.
  The current lack of \acr{ATOW} is typically compensated by assuming it to be equal to a certain
  percentage of the \acr{MTOW} for the relevant aircraft model.  
  With this challenge we aim at making available a better way to
  estimate \acr{ATOW}.

* Why an Open model?  
  The \acr{PRC} (and many other Organizations, industrial actors and academia by the way) is interested
  in studies assessing the impact of Aviation to Climate Change.
  To this extent the availability of an open model allows for reproducibility, transparency of
  the results presented and in the end to trust.  

* Why via a Challenge?  
  The \acr{PRC} thinks that there is a great pool of Data Scientists that could help to define
  the open model of the Challenge, but above that it is the importance to have a "white box" approach
  to the way the model is being built that drove the decision to setup a Data Challenge.
  This transparency is a way to build trust, reproducibility and eventually evolve a collaboration
  to improve the understanding of the impact of Aviation to the environment.
