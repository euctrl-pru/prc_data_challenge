title: "PRC Data Challenge"
---

The \acr{PRC} Data Challenge aims at engaging with data scientists, even without
Aviation background, to create teams and compete to
build an **open** \acr{ML} model able to accurately infer the \acr{ATOW} of a
flown flight.



## The Data
See the [Data page](data.html) for more details.

## The why of Why

We got many questions about this challenge. We grouped and answered them as follows:

* Why is the challenge focusing on \acr{ATOW}?  
  \acr{ATOW} is an important input for models estimating fuel burnt and derived
  gaseous emissions.  
  The current lack of openly available \acr{ATOW} is typically compensated by
  assuming it to be equal to a certain percentage of the \acr{MTOW} for the
  relevant aircraft model.  
  With this challenge we aim at making available a better way to
  estimate \acr{ATOW}, i.e. an \acr{ETOW}.

* Why an Open model?  
  The \acr{PRC} (and many other Organizations, industrial actors and academia
  by the way) is interested in studies assessing the impact of Aviation to
  Climate Change.
  To this extent the availability of an open model allows for reproducibility,
  transparency of the results presented and in the end to **trust** in the
  performed analyses.

* Why via a Data Challenge?  
  The \acr{PRC} thinks that there is a great pool of Data Scientists that could
  help to define the open model of the Challenge, but above that, it is the
  importance to have a _white box_ approach to the way the model is being built
  that drove the decision to setup a Data Challenge.  
  This transparency is a way to build trust, reproducibility and eventually
  evolve a collaboration to improve the understanding of (and reducing)
  the impact of Aviation to the environment.

## Eligibility for Participation

Any data science and/or aviation enthusiast team or individual can participate
to the challenge.

Please send a team creation email with the following info:

1. you team name
1. list of members (names, eventual affiliations, [at least one for correspondence]
   email addresses)
1. (optional but nice to have) who you are
1. (optional but nice to have) rationale for participation

After a little while, you will then receive the relevant access/secret keys
to acces the relevant [Data](data.html).

**NOTE**: Anyone affiliated with OpenSky Network or EUROCONTROL is not eligible
to participate to the PRC Data Challenge.
