title: "PRC Data Challenge"
---

The \acr{PRC} Data Challenge aims at engaging with data scientists, even without
Aviation background, to create teams and compete to
build an **open** \acr{ML} model able to accurately infer the \acr{ATOW} of a
flown flight.

## The Data

We provide information for **369013** flights flown all over Europe in 2022.
Flight data include origin/destination airport, aircraft type,
off-block and arrival times,...and estimated \acr{TOW}.
Thanks to the collaboration with \acr{OSN} we added the relevant trajectories 
at (max) 1 second granularity, accounting for around 158 GiB of parquet files.

The 105959 flights of the `submission_set.csv` will be used to rank the intermediate 
submissions before the deadline, and an additional 52190 will be used for the 
final prize ranking.

See the [Data page](data.html) for more details.


## The Prize

A total prize of $5000$ EUR will be distributed among the finalists' teams.  
Each finalist will receive a prize to acknowledge their innovative ideas and
contributions towards solving the posed challenge problem.  

The submission deadline was on: [**`2024-10-28T00:00:00Z`**]{.hugedate}.

Winners' announcements took place at the [12th edition of OpenSky Symposium][osnsym]
in Hamburg on 7th--8th November 2024.

## Code and docs

Code and documentation from participating teams is available.
We forked all public repositories of participating teams and
grouped them in a GitHub organization

<https://github.com/prc-data-challenge-2024>

In the near future we plan to add further material.

## The why of Why

We got many questions about this challenge. We grouped and answered them as follows:

* Why is the challenge focusing on \acr{ATOW}?  
  \acr{ATOW} is an important input for models estimating fuel burnt and derived
  gaseous emissions.  
  The current lack of openly available \acr{ATOW} is typically compensated by
  assuming it to be equal to a certain percentage of the \acr{MTOW} for the
  relevant aircraft model.  
  With this challenge we aim at making available a better way to
  estimate \acr{ATOW}, i.e. an \acr{ETOW}.

* Why an Open model?  
  The \acr{PRC} (and many other Organizations, industrial actors and academia
  by the way) is interested in studies assessing the impact of Aviation to
  Climate Change.
  To this extent the availability of an open model allows for reproducibility,
  transparency of the results presented and in the end to **trust** in the
  performed analyses.

* Why via a Data Challenge?  
  The \acr{PRC} thinks that there is a great pool of Data Scientists (much bigger
  than that of Aviation Experts!) that could help defining the _open_ model of
  the Challenge.  
  The Challenge also makes it possible to have a _white box_ approach to the way
  the model is being defined which goes in the direction of transparency.
  This transparency is a way to build trust, reproducibility and eventually
  evolve a collaboration to improve the understanding (and the reduction) of
  the impact of Aviation to the environment.

## Eligibility for Participation

Any data science and/or aviation enthusiast team or individual can participate
to the challenge.

Please send an email for the team creation with the following info (this will be publicly
visible [apart from emails] in a dedicated teams' page):

1. an \acr{OSN} account ([create one][osnlog] if you do not have it yet)
1. corresponding member: name + email address
1. list of members: team member name (eventual affiliation) + email address (optional)
1. who you are: a description of the team
1. rationale for participation

to

>   challenge AT opensky-network.org

A little while later, you will receive the team name and
the relevant access/secret keys to obtain the [Data](data.html)
via your \acr{OSN} account; something
like:

```json
{
  "team_name": "team_warm_donkey",
  "team_id": "b8e3a438-d2f2-4a11-bf28-e7a8f84cf3db",
  "bucket_access_key": "blah",
  "bucket_access_secret": "blahblah"
}
```

::: {.callout-note}
Anyone affiliated with OpenSky Network or EUROCONTROL is **not eligible**
to participate to the PRC Data Challenge.
