## team_vigorous_jungle

### Description
We are a group of software engineers with diverse backgrounds in machine learning and a shared passion for data science and machine learning. Our team actively contributes to open-source projects across different fields, allowing us to develop complex solutions that tackle real-world challenges

### Rationale for participation
We are particularly interested in tracking flight records and addressing the current gap in open-source models for predicting critical aviation parameters. Our experience in data science and machine learning equips us well for this challenge, especially as it involves large datasets within a specific domain that we find both challenging and fascinating
