### Description
Our team, comprising members from Serbia and the USA, brings together a unique blend of expertise in aviation and machine learning to tackle the PRC Data Challenge. Emir GaniÄ‡, a research associate at the University of Belgrade, Serbia, has over a decade of experience in aviation, with a particular focus on airports, aircraft noise, engine emissions, unmanned aircraft systems, and sustainable aviation. His extensive research background is evidenced by his contributions to international monograph and over 30 scientific papers. He is also an active member of several prestigious organizations, including the European Aviation Noise Research Network (X-NOISE) and the TRB Standing Committee on Environmental Issues in Aviation, USA. Yanyu Wang, an Assistant Professor at Louisiana State University, USA, specializes in machine learning with a focus on aviation safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Her expertise in applying advanced machine learning techniques to solve complex aviation problems complements the team's objectives in developing innovative solutions for accurately estimating Actual TakeOff Weight (ATOW). Together, our team's diverse skills and experiences position us well to create a robust, open machine learning model that addresses the challenge's goals of transparency, reproducibility, and environmental impact reduction

### Rationale for participation
Our participation in the PRC Data Challenge is driven by a strong commitment to advancing aviation safety and sustainability in the context of climate change. This challenge presents a valuable opportunity to contribute to the development of an open Machine Learning model for accurately estimating ATOW, a critical factor in improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions. We are excited to collaborate together on this challenge as a team, confident that our efforts will lead to meaningful advancements in understanding and mitigating the environmental impact of aviation
