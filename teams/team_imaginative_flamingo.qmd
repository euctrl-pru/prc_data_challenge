### Description
I am currently a student of a Master's degree course in Scientific and Data-Intensive Computing at the University of Trieste, Italy

### Rationale for participation
I find the PRC Data Challenge a terrific opportunity to challenge myself in my field of study, but with a much more practical approach. I have been long devoted to open source software and I much appreciate the idea of exploiting crowd-harvested data for creating a crowd-devised model and making it publicly available, in order for it to be worked upon and improved
