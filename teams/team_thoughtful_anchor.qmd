## team_thoughtful_anchor

### Description
I'm an individual participant from South Korea. I love finding meaningful points from data. I think aviation data is attractive because it can show what is happening in the air

### Rationale for participation
I used to work as a flight dispatcher. Since then, I have always been interested in assessing the impact of aviation on climate change. I feel like I can resolve my curiosity about the relationship between ATOW and released gas
