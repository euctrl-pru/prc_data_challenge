### Description
Our team is composed of Emanuele Bossi, a dual major student in Data Science and Software Engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Prescott campus, and Dr. Rahman R. AlMomani, an Assistant Professor of Data Science and Mathematics at the same university. The student will be mentored by the professor as we work together to develop a Machine Learning model to predict the best Aircraft Takeoff Weight (ATOW) of a flown flight

### Rationale for participation
We are passionate about contributing to cutting-edge research in the aviation industry. This competition provides an exceptional opportunity to apply our knowledge in data science and machine learning to real-world aviation challenges. By participating, we aim to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in flight optimization and contribute to advancements that could have a significant impact on the industry
