## team_zany_fireplace

### Description
I work in the aviation industry and have a PhD in air transportation systems

### Rationale for participation
My interest lies in big data processing in aviation and transportation systems. I process ample amounts of radar data on a regular basis but don't get to perform any exploratory analysis, which I love.
