## team_organized_volcano

### Description
We are three friends who met during their physics studies and are now pursuing different paths related to data science. Loving both aviation (mainly Dennis) and data science (all of us)

### Rationale for participation
we are curious to find out whether we can provide a model that predicts the ATOW better than other submissions. We are very much looking forward to the fun we are going to have tackling this question
