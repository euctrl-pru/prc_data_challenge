### Description
I teach courses in data analytics, programming, and database management at the University of Illinois.  I’m also an ADSB flight data enthusiast/hobbiest

### Rationale for participation
I have been using my own receiver’s ADSB data plus some selected public data from OSN as example data sets for one assignment in each of two courses I teach
