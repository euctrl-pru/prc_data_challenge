### Description
master's students at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA) in Brazil, with a strong interest in the fields of aeronautics, encompassing mechanical, electrical, and computational engineering

### Rationale for participation
Some of our dissertations address similar challenges, focused on enhancing our skills in machine learning and deepening our knowledge in areas such as aircraft systems, avionics, and flight dynamics. The challenge is a good way to reach the best version of us and spread a new solution to the problem
