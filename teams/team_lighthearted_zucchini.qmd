### Description
A solo practitioner data scientist based in the United States

### Rationale for participation
Over the past several years I've developed a particular interest in spatial data analysis and geospatial data science. That work has focused mainly on human mobility and transportation, and through those efforts I began working with aviation and flight trajectory data. I think this data challenge offers a great opportunity to marry my interests to a problem with both important industry and broader climate implications
